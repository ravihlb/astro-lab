## Developing - Quick Setup
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm` :

```bash
pnpm [install]
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
